UNS is an interchain, global name service, a distributed, open, and extensible system based on the mostly used blockchains.
UNS can be used to resolve a wide variety of resources. The initial standard for UNS defines resolution for BinanceSmartChain (BSC) addresses, 
but the system will be extended by design, allowing more blockchain types to be resolved in future without the core components of UNS requiring upgrades. 

The primary objective of UNS is to resolve human-readable names, like myname.uns, into machine-readable identifiers, 
including BSC addresses, Swarm and IPFS content hashes, and other identifiers. 

A secondary purpose is to provide metadata about names, such as ABIs for contracts, and whois information for users. 

Finally, coverage of all blockchains is considered.
